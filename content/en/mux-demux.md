**Muxing:**  Combines multiple streams into a single multimedia container for efficient storage, transmission, and playback.
**Demuxing:** Extracts individual streams from a multimedia container, allowing for independent processing and playback of each component.

Together, muxing and demuxing are fundamental processes in multimedia handling, enabling the creation, distribution, and manipulation of multimedia content in a variety of applications. The detail are as follows:
Here is some common media multiplexing format:
- FLV
- MP4
- MKV
- AVI
- MOV
- WEBM


## Media Muxing (Multiplexing)

**Definition:** Media muxing, or multiplexing, is the process of combining multiple streams of data, often of different types (audio, video, subtitles, etc.), into a single container format. The resulting file is referred to as a multimedia container. Muxing allows for the synchronization and packaging of diverse media components into a cohesive unit.

**Process:**

1. **Input Streams:** Gather multiple streams of data, such as audio, video, and subtitles, each in its raw or encoded format.
2. **Container Format Selection:** Choose a container format (e.g., MP4, MKV, AVI) that supports the types of streams being combined.
3. **Muxing Algorithm:** Use a muxing algorithm to interleave and synchronize the different streams into the chosen container format.
4. **Output Container:** The result is a single file, the multimedia container, which holds all the combined streams in an organized structure.

**Purpose:**

- Efficient Storage and Transmission: Muxing allows for efficient storage and transmission of multimedia content as a single file.
- Synchronization: Streams within the container are synchronized, ensuring proper playback.

## Media Demuxing (Demultiplexing)

**Definition:** Media demuxing, or demultiplexing, is the process of extracting individual streams from a multimedia container. It reverses the multiplexing process, allowing each component stream to be accessed independently.

**Process:**

1. **Input Container:** Take a multimedia container file that was created through muxing.
2. **Demuxing Algorithm:** Employ a demuxing algorithm to extract individual streams from the container.
3. **Output Streams:** Obtain separate streams for each media type (audio, video, subtitles) in their original format.
4. **Further Processing:** Once demuxed, individual streams can be manipulated or played back independently.

**Purpose:**

- Editing and Processing: Demuxing is crucial for video editing and processing workflows, where individual streams need to be accessed separately for manipulation.
- Playback: Demuxing is necessary for multimedia players to access and play back the different components of a multimedia file.
