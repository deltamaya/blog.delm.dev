# Teleology

The first concept presented in the book is "teleology." Distinct from Freud's "causality," Adler posits that one's current problematic behaviors are not a result of past psychological trauma but are instead naturally developed to fulfill certain purposes. This does not mean the pain felt by individuals is not real; rather, it indicates that these pains are self-created, serving to achieve certain personal objectives.
This notion underlies all the viewpoints in the book, suggesting that our "unhappiness" is not solely determined by fate or the past, but rather by our own purposes.  
**What matters is not what you have been given but how well you utilize what you have been given.**  
If you choose, you can be happy.

# All Troubles Arise from Interpersonal Relationships

This idea was quite novel to me, and I believe it is accurate.  
What is the smallest unit of interpersonal relationships? Two people.  
Imagine a universe where you are the only person; would your current troubles still exist? Whether relating to inherent flaws or unattainable aspirations, all of them would vanish.  
However, we cannot live in isolation, so how do we extricate ourselves from the troubles arising from interpersonal relationships?

## Life is Not a Competition with Others

First, we need to realize that life is not a competition with others. Each individual's starting point and direction are different; life is a personal journey.  
Yet, Adler acknowledges the existence of feelings of inferiority and the human desire for superiority. However, this inferiority should not stem from comparisons with others but rather from comparing ourselves to our "ideal self." Our task is simply to walk our own path and continuously surpass our previous selves.

### Manifestations of Inferiority Complex

The book also mentions that sometimes feelings of inferiority can develop into an "inferiority complex." This manifests in thoughts like, "I failed at B because of A," implying that if A had not happened, I would have surely succeeded at B. The true self is exceptional, yet one remains immersed in such fantasies, unwilling to forego the pleasures of the moment to make genuine efforts, lacking the courage to change oneself.

It can even devolve into a "superiority complex," where the inability to change oneself leads to compensating for it by presenting oneself as superior, thus indulging in a false sense of superiority.

Another example is "boasting about misfortune," which serves as a compensatory mechanism for those unwilling to change their situation.

### Breaking Free from Competition

If "competition" still exists in your interpersonal relationships, it becomes impossible to escape the troubles they bring, and thus, unhappiness cannot be avoided. This is because where there is competition, there are winners and losers. To avoid becoming a loser, you may unconsciously tighten yourself, regarding everyone around you as "enemies."

People live in their subjective worlds. When you perceive those around you as a group of enemies who will exploit your every flaw to mock, ridicule, or even attack you, the world becomes a terrifying place. The horror of competition lies therein.

Moreover, viewing others as enemies naturally makes it impossible to sincerely celebrate others' successes since the success of an enemy feels like your failure. In truth, not many people care about you or wish you harm; people can become **partners**, and it’s important to build "horizontal relationships" rather than hierarchical "vertical relationships."

In terms of interpersonal dynamics, no matter how certain you are of your correctness, you must avoid using it as a reason to criticize others, as this can lead to power struggles. Once you view yourself as correct, you will consider others as wrong, and issues evolve from a conflict of right and wrong to a struggle between relationships, ultimately becoming a battle to "win."  
Additionally, one should recognize that admitting mistakes, apologizing, and stepping back from power struggles are not signs of "failure."

## Separation of Tasks

### Life Tasks

When an individual wishes to exist as a social being, they will inevitably face interpersonal relationships, which constitutes the tasks of life.  
The three main life tasks are: work tasks, friendship tasks, and love tasks.

### Life Lies

To avoid facing certain situations or individuals, we often fabricate certain so-called "reasons," claiming that these reasons are why we cannot succeed in these tasks. However, this is simply a means to mask the courage to step forward or the laziness behind inaction.  
Adler refers to these excuses used to evade the tasks of life as "**life lies**."

### Separating Life Tasks

It is essential to distinguish your tasks from those of others. If after an event you are the one ultimately responsible, then that is your life task; conversely, if this is not the case, it pertains to others. Once you have clearly separated your tasks, refrain from interfering with others' life tasks, and naturally, ensure that others do not intrude upon your tasks easily.

> Regarding your own life, what you can do is to "choose the path you believe is best." On the other hand, how others evaluate you is their task, which you cannot control.

There is a saying: **You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot force it to drink.** It is crucial to maintain interpersonal relationships within reach, while not getting too close. **The separation of tasks is not the endpoint of relationships but rather the starting point.**

## Freedom is Being Disliked

Your life is for you to live—not for the approval of others. If you do not live for yourself, who will live for you? Do not exist in others' expectations.  
When those around you do not recognize you, **not recognizing you is their life task;** whether or not they affirm themselves is not an issue you need to interfere with.

As humans, we all have a desire for affirmation, yet pursuing such desire blindly does not reflect true freedom. True freedom is about resisting the desire, which means **having the courage to be disliked.**

**If you do not disregard others' evaluations, fear being disliked, and do not seek approval from others, you will not be able to fully commit to your own lifestyle, and thus, you will never attain freedom.**

### Individual Psychology

Adler's psychology is also known as "individual psychology." As discussed previously, it is essential to perform the separation of life tasks; all troubles stem from interpersonal relationships, and only by successfully separating these tasks can we alleviate these concerns. However, upon closer inspection, simply doing this can lead to isolation or self-centeredness.

Thus, it is important to understand that the so-called "individual" is "indivisible," or "atomic." The separation of life tasks is not meant to sever connections with others, **but rather is the start of interpersonal relationships,** serving as the fundamental premise for horizontal relationships.

So, where is the endpoint of interpersonal relationships? Adler offers the answer: "social interest," which means viewing others as partners and feeling that "you have a place." As noted before, all troubles arise from interpersonal relationships, and likewise, all happiness stems from them.

You are not the center of the world but rather the center of the world map.  
Each of us exists in the world while simultaneously belonging to many communities, such as society, family, school, and workplace. If we encounter difficulties or cannot see a way out in a particular community relationship, we must remember to listen to the voices of the "greater community." There is no need to stubbornly cling to the current smaller community; many other "I and you" relationships, a larger "everyone," and greater communities undoubtedly exist.

### No Praise or Criticism

We all know that criticism is a toxic form of education; it demotivates others. But what about praise? The book provides a fresh perspective: praise is the assessment of the capable towards the incapable, which makes others feel they have not contributed and lack value.

Adler’s psychology opposes all "vertical relationships" and advocates viewing all interpersonal relationships as "horizontal relationships."  
In horizontal relationships, how should you help others? We should understand that when people hear words of gratitude, they recognize their contributions to others and feel valuable; this is when they become confident. Thus, the solution is clear: do not "interfere" and "evaluate" others, but rather offer thanks and encouragement.

### Horizontal Relationships

If you establish a vertical relationship with someone, you will unconsciously perceive all interpersonal relationships in a "vertical" manner. For instance, you might think, "A is not as good as me; B is better than me." Conversely, if you can foster a horizontal relationship, one of true equality, it becomes a significant change in lifestyle. Using this breakthrough, all relationships can evolve towards "horizontal" development.

The author cites the example of someone who feels they cannot defy their boss, suggesting this is an excuse to evade responsibility for unsatisfactory work outcomes — "life lies."

## Three Elements of Social Interest

Previously mentioned was the concept of social interest — the feeling of having a meaningful presence in a community. Here we can introduce three essential components for establishing one’s social interest: self-acceptance, trust in others, and contribution to others.

### Self-Acceptance

Different from self-recognition, self-acceptance leans towards “how to utilize what has been given” rather than “what has been given to oneself.” Accept your determined self and work on further improvement based on your shortcomings.

### Trust in Others

The trust mentioned here is unconditional trust in others, not trust based on their credibility; you can still trust someone even if they have betrayed you in the past. When you trust someone, it indicates that person is a "partner" and not an "enemy." However, not everyone in the world is good. If you discover someone consistently betraying your trust, you may sever ties with them.

### Contribution to Others

The book mentions that happiness stems from the feeling of being “useful to others,” which is about contributing to others. A person only feels their value when they realize, "I am useful to others." This contribution can also occur in invisible forms; as long as there is a subjective feeling of being "useful to others" — the sense of contribution, it suffices.

However, this does not mean one should blindly pursue recognition from others. First, recognition from others is their task, and you should not interfere. Secondly, changing oneself and compromising for the sake of approval from others will lead to a loss of freedom, and freedom is the premise for pursuing happiness.

### The Courage to Be Ordinary

"Ordinary" does not signify "incompetency." We do not need to showcase our superiority.

## Dancing Through Life

Life is not a line but a series of continuous moments.  
We do not need an ideal figure far above us to constrain us; we only need to make the most of the present moment, and enjoying the "here and now" is enough.  
There is no destination in life; **the act of dancing itself is the purpose.**

Potential movement refers to the journey before reaching the destination as incomplete.  
Reality movement indicates action that is "completed in the moment it is done," reflecting the notion of "**seeing the process itself as the result.**"

Like traveling, the journey begins the moment you step out of your doorway. Regardless of what happens along the way, it does not affect the existence of the journey — this is the reality of life.

## The Most Important "Here and Now"

Like a stage, if a soft light is cast over the entire stage, one can see both the past and the future. However, if a strong spotlight is directed solely at the "here and now," one will see neither the past nor the future.

What has happened in the past is unrelated to the "here and now," and what may happen in the future is not a concern for the "here and now."  
Life no longer requires a narrative.

### The Biggest "Life Lie"

The biggest lie in life is "not living in the here and now," getting entangled in the past, and focusing on the future without pondering how to spend this moment.  
Setting a goal for a distant future and telling oneself, "This is what I want to do; I will do it when the opportunity arises" is a lifestyle of procrastination. As long as we procrastinate in life, we make no progress, and daily life becomes monotonous. In this state, one perceives the "here and now" merely as a phase of preparation and endurance.  
Even without a goal, living earnestly in the present moment is, in itself, dancing.  
In truth, the decisive factors are neither the past nor the future, but the "here and now."  
Also, remember this: life always exists in a "closed state." Whether a life concludes at 20 or 90, it is completed; both can be fulfilling lives.

### The Meaning of Life

**There is no universal meaning of life.** It is precisely because of this that you can attribute your own meaning to life, and only you have the power to impart meaning to your existence. Your powers are immense; the world changes not because of others but because of your actions.

If you feel lost in your current life, it is because you seek to choose freedom. In the pursuit of freedom, it is indeed possible to lose one's way. Thus, Adler proposes a "guiding star" for life, akin to the North Star. Just as we need our "guiding star," so too we need "contribution to others"; as long as we do not lose sight of this pointer and move in that direction, we can attain happiness.
